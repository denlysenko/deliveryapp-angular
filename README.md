#### WARNING

Before launching mobile applications locally (or on the emulator) and building an ios / android application, make sure that you have the nativescript-plugin-firebase plugin installed (at the time of development it was ^ 9.0.1). Run this command `npm install nativescript-plugin-firebase@^9.0.1`. This package has been removed from package.json because installing it fails CI and deployment
